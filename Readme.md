# Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria [SLUS-21452 CC96CE93]

## Let the game remove characters when they're suppsoed to be removed in the story

The current code wont let any main character be removed from the party, not even when they're supposed to

## Lower the character's level when they join the team in the beginning of the game

Find a way to make the characters be level 1 when they join the starting party. Probably will have to look for an initial setup.
This will be really hard to do since this setup can be anywhere

## Multiple copies of a character without having to go to the debugger

Change the code that creates 99 copies of a character to create only 2 or 4. Can be done with extended script
