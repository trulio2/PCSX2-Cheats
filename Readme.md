### Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria [SLUS-21452 CC96CE93]

- Find a way to make the characters be level 1 when they join the starting party. Probably will have to look for an initial setup.
  This will be really hard to do since this setup could be anywhere

- Also, when random characters join the team, their level will be an average of the team total level, so lowering the level
  of the characters will solve this too
